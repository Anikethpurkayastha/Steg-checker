Description

The Steganography Detection Web App is a Flask-based web application designed to detect hidden data embedded within image files using steganography techniques, particularly Least Significant Bit (LSB) analysis. Users can upload images (PNG, JPG, JPEG), and the application will analyze the pixel data to identify any unusual patterns that may indicate the presence of concealed information.

This tool is useful for cybersecurity analysts, digital forensic investigators, and anyone interested in uncovering hidden data within seemingly innocent media files. With a user-friendly interface and real-time analysis, the app simplifies the process of steganalysis and provides quick insights into image integrity.
